# ☕ Coffee API

Welcome to the Coffee API — a modern RESTful service built with [NestJS](https://nestjs.com/) for managing and exploring a collection of coffees and their flavors.

## What does this API do?

The Coffee API allows you to:

- **List all coffees** with optional pagination
- **Retrieve details** about a specific coffee by its ID
- **Explore available coffee flavors**
- **Add new coffees** to the collection
